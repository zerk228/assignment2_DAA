# Heap Sort (Student B — Pair 2)

## 🔍 Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Heap Sort** for *Assignment 2 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)*.  
The algorithm follows an **in-place implementation with bottom-up heap construction** (Floyd’s method) and iterative heapify operations to avoid recursion.

The project includes:
- Clean Java implementation (`HeapSort.java`)
- CLI benchmark runner producing CSV results
- Metrics tracking (comparisons, swaps, allocations, runtime)
- Comprehensive JUnit5 test suite
- Automated CI with GitHub Actions
